# cicada

My own personal collection of data structures implemented in C.

## Data Structures

- [ ] Hash Map
- [ ] Set
- [x] [Dynamic Array (Vector)](./src/vector/vector.h)
- [ ] Priority Queue
- [x] Doubly Linked List
- [ ] AVL Tree
- [ ] Red Black Tree
- [ ] Skip List

All data structures use `void*` as values to implement generic storage. They are **NOT** thread safe.

## Documentation

Coming soon.

## Testing

Cicada is written in C11 and has no dependencies. Can be built with clang or gcc.

```sh
cd tests
make
./tests
```
